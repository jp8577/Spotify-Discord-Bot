# SpotifyStats-Discord-Bot

Author: Jooahn Park

This is a project I made because I wanted to see my top songs and artists before Spotify Wrapped is released. The user logs in to Spotify and the Discord bot displays their top songs/artists through commands. As of now this is only for personal use, but in the future I plan to expand my bot to handle multiple users and to add more features. Here is some example usage:
